# Barbot
My Barbot project

This repository stores all the design artifacts for the project and is freely
available to anyone who wants to learn about my project.

## Why?

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of barbots made by makers all over the world.
It might be a right of passage for some, but for me, it was an interesting idea that
gave me an excuse to learn some new things.

I had the idea to build one of these things years ago with a friend. The main detraction
for me was that most barbot build I've seen are either too large or too slow, in my
opinion. If I was going to build one of these, it had to be small and convenient
enough to easily store when not in use, easy to clean after being used, and it couldn't
take forever to dispense a drink.
Those requirements are completely subjective but I eventually came up
with some numbers that would satisfy me. My goals were to be able to store the device
on an existing shelf in a spare room in my house and it had to be able to make me a
drink (e.g., a rum and coke) in under 10 seconds. The cleaning aspect is more difficult
to quantify but I didn't want to have to disassemble the device or do anything else
drastic to get it cleaned up.

## How?

In the spring of 2018 I revisited the idea of building a barbot when I found some
published builds using peristaltic pumps. I had never considered individual pumps
for each ingredient, but doing so solved some of the problems I felt other designs
suffered from. After investigating, I discovered peristaltic pumps generally come
in two forms, small and slow, or large and expensive. Neither was satisfactory, so
I started  considering making my own pumps. This eventually led to 3D printing,
something I had never really had a need of before. I started designing a
pump that could meet my needs and eventually bought a 3D printer and started
building a prototype. After a few iterations and lots of fiddling around, I came
up with a design that worked. You can find out more about the pump [here](3D).

Once I had the pump designed and tested, the possibility of building a complete
barbot became real. All I would need to do was the rest of the design and build.

## More to come...
