    Tall, chimney-shaped glasses are good for gin-and-tonics,
    vodka and club sodas, and whiskey and gingers — but also
    can be repurposed for tiki drinks made with crushed ice.

  description: >
    Good for cocktails served "up," meaning it’s been shaken or
    stirred with ice and then served chilled, without ice — like
    a Martini. The stem means you don’t heat up the cocktail
    with your hand as you sip it.

    Used for anything neat, any spirit on the rocks, though also
    used for stirred, chilled, spirituous cocktails served "down,"
    meaning it’s served chilled, but in a glass without a stem.
