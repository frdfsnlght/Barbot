These are SketchUp Pro 2017 files for the most part.

## Enclosure

This file contains the model for the entire enclosure and most of the internal parts, except for the
pumps. Printable parts have been exported as STL to the STLs directory.

## Pump

This file contains all the parts for the planetary gear, peristaltic pump I designed. Every part except
the stepper motor can be printed and all parts have been exported to the STLs directory.
